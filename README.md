Questions about git.
In this repository I want to collect questions about git.

How to ask questions:

1. use English;
2. check FAQ.md and see if your question is already answered;
3. if you already know the answer of your question, try to add it to FAQ.md,
   commit and push to your fork and file a pull request;
4. if you do not know the answer to your question, open an issue and ask it;
5. if you know the answer of an open issue, try to answer it;
6. if you obtain a good answer to your question, go to point 2.
